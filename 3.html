        <h1>Introduction & History about HTML</h1>
        <p id="childparagraph">
            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents<br>
            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies <br>
            such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <br>
            render the documents into multimedia web pages.HTML describes the structure of a <br>
            web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images <br>
            and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
            HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics<br>
            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.Browsers <br>
            do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.HTML<br>
            can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects <br>
            the behavior and content of web pages.Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of <br>
            content.The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current<br>
             maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational<br> 
             HTML since 1997.<br>
