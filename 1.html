        <h1>Introduction & History about Java</h1>
        <p id ="childparagraph">Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented,and designed <br>
            to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers <br>
            write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support<br>
            Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run<br>
            on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java<br>
            is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of <br>
            the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications,<br>
            with a reported 9 million developers.
