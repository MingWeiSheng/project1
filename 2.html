        <h1>Introduction & History about C language</h1>
        <p id = "childparagraph">
           C  is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,<br>
           lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. <br>
           C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting <br>
           use in applications previously coded in assembly language.During the 1980s, C gradually gained<br>
           popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages with C compilers from<br>
           various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.<br>
           C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the International Organization for<br>
           Standardization.C is an imperative procedural language.It was designed to be compiled using a relatively<br>
           straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently<br>
           to machine instructions,all with minimal runtime support.Despite its low-level capabilities, the language<br>
           was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.A standards-compliant C program written with <br>
           portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems<br>
            with few changes to its source code.The language is available on various platforms from embedded<br>
             microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>
