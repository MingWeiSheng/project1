            Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. <br>
            Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy<br>
            emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. <br>
            Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers <br>
            write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically<br>
            typed and garbage-collected.It supports multiple programming paradigms, including<br>
            procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described <br>
            as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.<br>
