        <P>
            There are total five pages that made up my website. And the client of my website wants to let <br>
            cs major students or someone who shows interest in coding or some beginners find some basic <br>
            knowledge and examples in this site.Therefore, I supply five coding languages for them to choose.<br>
             They can learn these languages by clicking the link that I put in my main page. My sub pages will<br>
            be opened in a new window. And my site maintains a coherent style across its pages.My pages and <br>
            stylesheet all passed the test of the W3Câ€™s HTML validator and CSS validator.As well, my site is <br>
            served out of port 8443 and accessed only through HTTPS. I also made a form that my clients can make<br>
            some comments that mailed to my mailbox, so that i can do some adjustments.Also, all of the sources<br>
            that I used in my site have been arranged in different folders clearly.<br> 

            <br>
            critique:
            My clients thought the format of my site looks not very clearly, so i changed the layout and teh background <br>
            so that they can read clearly.<br>
            And they thought my sources about language learning are not detailed, so i find more examples and websites to<br>
            to help them learn more.
